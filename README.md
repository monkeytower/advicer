# advicer for Flutter > version 3

Sample project from the [Udemy Flutter course](https://www.udemy.com/share/10588g3@i2wySLuqPEV9W0Ty6XunilxlvkzjwGy5BotXNTVMF6mQLSgj-uwUAq7-eLrNNz95/) of Max Berktold
Original repository available at https://github.com/OpenSphereSoftware/FlutterLeichtGemacht_ZeroToMasery/tree/main/advicer

## Scope

I'm going trough this course and the original repository helps only partial, since it shows files with the state at the end of the course. I messed up my own files several times due to typs (forgotten brackets and such. 
It might be a good idea to fork after each chapter..


## Getting Started
